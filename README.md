# Bear Sightings API

An API that allows users to submit bear sightings as they happen and to query the database for recent sightings with certain filters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project is built with Express and SQLite3.
Install the dependencies by running `yarn` before starting the server.

### Running the server

Simply start the server from your terminal by calling `node index.js`. The server will run on port 3000 by default.
I suggest [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for hitting the endpoints.

## Running the tests

`yarn test`
